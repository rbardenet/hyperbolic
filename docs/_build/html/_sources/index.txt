   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to hyperbolic's documentation!
======================================

`hyperbolic` is the companion code to the paper XXX.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Running the paper's experiments
===============================

The main class implements a complete experiment.

    .. autoclass:: hyperbolic.Experiment
                   :members: sampleWhiteNoise, performAWT, findZeros, plotResults
                   :member-order: bysource

A complete example
==================
Simply run `examples/example1.py`, which contains

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example1.py

The output should be

.. testsetup:: *

    import sys
    sys.path.append("../hyperbolic")
    import hyperbolic as hype

.. testcode::
    xp = hype.Experiment(alpha=2.0) # initialize experiment, you can play with the parameters, hit shift+TAB for details
    xp.sampleWhiteNoise()
    xp.performAWT()
    xp.findZeros()
    xp.plotResults(boolShow=1)
